Hill Climber algorithm:
	
	Create an empty map
	
	Place houses for a starting map. Could be from the randomised algorithm or another.
	
	Repeat until no improvement for the last x times:
	
	    highest_value = value from starting map
	
	    for house in all_houses:
	        move house one place to 4 sides (so make 4 deepcopies)
	        check if placement is still valid
	        check from the valid placement which is the most valuable map and continue with that one
	
	        if no improvement:
	            go to next house
	
	        move house one place to 3 sides (old position is not necessary)
	        check if placement is still valid
	        check from the valid placement which is the most valuable and continue with that one
	
	        if no improvement:
	            go to next house
	
	    calculate new total value
	
	    if new_calculation > highest_value:
	        highest_value = new_calculation
